This is a quick course on the  <img src="/img/logo_sails.png" alt="Sails JS Logo" width="50"/> [Sails JS V 1.5](https://sailsjs.com/) MVC framework.

## What is an MVC Framework?

A Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components

- **Model**: Matters data, it's storage and retrieval.
- **View**: Displays data to the user.
- **Controller**: Interfaces the view and the Model, transforming data to view and vice-versa.

During this course, we'll learn how to create models, views and controllers as well as understand the underlying technologies.


## Why Sails.js ?
Sails.js's power lies in it's [Implicit/Automatic Routes](./sailsjs-controller-implicit-route) that cut down on development time.
While prototyping, you might not need to write controllers or action classes. This is the 30% of the aspects denoted by MVC - Model View Controller.

Cutting down 30% of development time is very suitable for a busy commercial environment where fast prototyping increases software's commercial viability, fast development matures the product, increasing it's utility and commercial value.
