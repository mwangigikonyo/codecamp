# Hello World
As with any new programming language, a "Hello World" gets us up and running very quickly.
You are already prepared to write your first Sails.js application.

## Generate a new Sails.js project
At this point, you should have already installed `NodeJS` and `Sails.js` framework. If not please
go back to [Installation](./installation) and make sure you understood the [Requisites](./requisites).

To generate a new Sails.js project, we need to use the `sails new` command.

```
sails new hello-world
```
