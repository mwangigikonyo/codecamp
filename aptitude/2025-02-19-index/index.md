# Aptitude Challenge for Commercial Software Engineers
This is in no way a mandatory course. The suggestions herin are purely suggestive and you can add, modify as you so try out these mindsets. 

However, I believe there's some value that you can derive that can challenge you and encourage you in your work.

In this section, I shall suggest the adoption of particular mindsets that can help you thrive in a busy commercial environment.

This section aims to do so by;
<ul>
    <li>Encouraging you to become self aware.</li>
    <li>Encouraging you to align your personal goals with team goals.</li>
    <li>Helping you derive maximum value from your work.</li>
</ul>



# About being self aware...
Take a pen and paper, write everything you know about yourself.
A week later, revisit the list. Did it change?
A year later, revisit the list. Did it change?
Most likely, this list grows and shrinks as you age.

You are the one who makes that descision as life demands you to and as you change yourself to align with your personal goals.

Whatever that list says, this is your point of view and the maintainance work of who you need to be is your effort. 

The cost of personality is the actions that build personality. You become who you decide to become, you become what you constantly work to become. 

You shape yourself at every stage of life. The work is to constantly check if you're progressing towards who or what you want to become.

So whowever you are, you have chosen to be whether consciously or not. 
It is best to be aware of what you're becoming. 

Just become aware that you are chosing and sometimes it's alright to chose different. 

Show up as who you want to become, for yourself and the team.

There's some truth in "fake it till you make it". In other words, practice makes perfect, especially in the sofware engineering field.

If you are the best software engineer around, then constantly ask yourself "What is the best sofware engineer doing right now?". Then, do the things the best sofware engineer would do.

If you are the best sales person, ask "what is the best sales person doing right now?", then go ahead and do that, or align to what that best sales person is doing.

Sometimes that thing to do is to take a break. Like meditate. Bask in the sun or go take a swim. Be human too.

Define that "you" and then show up and co-create with one of the best team of engineers around!
