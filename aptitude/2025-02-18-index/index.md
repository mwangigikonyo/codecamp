# Aptitude training for Commercial Software Engineers
This is in no way a mandatory course. However, I believe 
In this section, I shall suggest the adoption of particular mindsets that will help you thrive in a busy commercial environment by;
<ul>
    <l>Encouraging you to become self aware.</l>
    <l>Encouraging you to align your personal goals with team goals.</l>
    <l>Helping you derive maximum value from your work.</l>
</ul>



# About being self aware...
Take a pen and paper, write everything you know about yourself.
A week later, revisit the list. Did it change?
A year later, revisit the list. Did it change?
Most likely, this list grows and shrinks as you age.
You are the one who makes that descision as life demands.

Whatever that list says, this is your point of view and the maintainance work of who you need to be is your effort. The cost of personality is the actions of that personality. You become who you decide to become. You shape yourself at every stage of life.

Once you are aware of what you need to be, then you can write that list down, and make it the earlier list (the one of who you are already). So whowever you are, you have chosen to be. Just become aware that you are chosing and sometimes it's alright to chose different. "Show up and become" is what another writer wrote.
