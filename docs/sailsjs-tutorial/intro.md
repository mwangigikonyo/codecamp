# Intro

This is a quick course on the  <img src="/img/logo_sails.png" alt="Sails JS Logo" width="50"/>[Sails JS V 1.5](https://sailsjs.com/) MVC framework.

## What is an MVC Framework?

A Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework is a software architectural pattern that separates an application into three interconnected components

- **Model**: Matters data, it's storage and retrieval.
- **View**: Displays data to the user.
- **Controller**: Interfaces the view and the Model, transforming data to view and vice-versa.

During this course, we'll learn how to create models, views and controllers as well as understand the underlying technologies.
